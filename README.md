# SSL Indicator - Trading Robot Code

This code is a trading robot that utilizes the SSL (Schaff Trend Cycle) indicator to generate long-term and short-term trading signals. The SSL indicator is a trend-following oscillator that helps identify market trends and potential entry points.

## Developer: Forex Robot Easy Team
## Developer's Site: [forexroboteasy.com](https://forexroboteasy.com)

## Indicator Parameters
- CalculationPeriod: The calculation period for the SSL indicator. Default value is 14.

## Global Variables
- sslLineUpBuffer: Buffer to store the SSL line up values.
- sslLineDownBuffer: Buffer to store the SSL line down values.

## Initialization Function
The OnInit() function initializes the indicator buffers and sets the index buffers for the SSL lines.

## Deinitialization Function
The OnDeinit() function clears the indicator buffers.

## Start Function
The OnStart() function is the main function that is executed on every tick. It first retrieves the current price using the SymbolInfoDouble() function. Then, it calculates the SSL indicator values by iterating through the CalculationPeriod. The SSL lines are calculated based on the previous high and low prices. Finally, it checks for crossover signals between the current price and the SSL lines. If a crossover signal is detected, it generates a long-term or short-term signal.

## Error Handling Function
The OnError() function handles any errors that occur during the execution of the code.
